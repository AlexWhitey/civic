#### Guide
1. Get [Node 6.5 +](https://nodejs.org) - We recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Clone a fork of this repository to your workstation.
    1. Select the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner of the repository for 
        this project (https://github.com/hackoregon/team-budget-frontend). 
        That will create a forked repository in your GitHub workspace 
        (https://github.com/your-name/team-budget-frontend).
    2. On your local workstation, clone the forked repository:<br>
        `git clone https://github.com/your-name/team-budget-frontend.git`.
3. `cd team-budget-frontend` - Work in the new project directory.
4. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:hackoregon/team-budget-frontend.git` - 
    Configures your local repository, so that you can stay synchronized with the 
    shared project repository.
5. `npm i` - installs dependencies.
6. `npm start` - starts dev mode (watching tests + linter).
7. `npm test` - runs tests.
8. `npm run coverage` - runs tests and displays a coverage summary.
9. If you want to make any changes, please submit a Pull Request. 
    See the GitHub documentation, if you do not know how to do that. 
    For example, [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
    or more generally, [Collaborating with issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/).

#### Background
This code is based on the [hackoregon-frontend-starter](https://github.com/hackoregon/hackoregon-frontend-starter) project,
which is a template for Hack Oregon front-end development using React + Redux.
The purpose of starting from that baseline is so that the different projects 
will share a common design.
