    questionId: 1,
    question: 'Does your family have an action plan in response to a disaster?',
    recommendation: 'A plan should include a family meeting place, a travel plan from work and school, and include day and nighttime contingencies.',
  },
  {
    questionId: 2,
    question: 'Do you know at least 3 people who live within 3 blocks of you?',
    recommendation: 'Knowing your neighbors makes your neighborhood safer and more resilient. Since first responders cannot be everywhere after a disaster, neighbors will likely be the first ones to help those in need.\n',
  },
  {
    questionId: 3,
    question: 'Do you have a 3-day evacuation kit?',
    recommendation: 'It should include 3 days of supplies, including water, food, an AM/FM emergency radio with extra batteries, basic first aid, and some kind of blankets or shelter. It will provide for your family in the event that you cannot stay in your home.\n',
  },
  {
    questionId: 4,
    question: 'Do you have 2 weeks of food and water for your household?',
    recommendation: 'Water supplies for 2 weeks will require 14 gallons of water per person in your household. Food supplies can include all kinds of non-perishable items, such as canned food, freeze-dried, and MREs.',
  },
  {
    questionId: 5,
    question: 'Do you have a 2-bucket toilet system?',
    recommendation: 'After a major disaster, water and sewer infrastructure will not be functional for some time. A 2-bucket toilet system keeps human waste sterile and secure and populations healthy.',
  },
  {
    questionId: 6,
    question: 'Is the interior of your house earthquake-safe?',
    recommendation: 'Securing your house should include strapping tall, heavy furniture to the wall and moving heavy mirrors or art pieces away from beds and desks.',
  },
  {
    questionId: 7,
    question: 'Do have a communication plan in the event of a disaster?',
    recommendation: 'It is likely that cell phones will not work for some time after a disaster. Walkie-talkies and hand-held AM/FM radios will be a good way to communicate. The city of Portland has a plan for two-way radio communications across the city called BEECN.',
  },
  {
    questionId: 8,
    question: 'Have you considered becoming a neighborhood resilience champion?',
    recommendation: 'Neighborhood Emergency Teams (NETs) are Portland residents trained by PBEM and Portland Fire & Rescue to provide emergency disaster assistance within their own neighborhoods. NET members are trained to save lives and property until professional responders can arrive. These volunteers are specially trained to help others without putting themselves in harmâ€™s way. BEECN volunteers are trained to assist with radio operations across the city of Portland.',
