# Dev Server

A simple express server that integrates with webpack, webpack dev middleware, and webpack hot middleware. This package
is depended on by project packages for a consistent development experience that emulates the environment of a year project
package.

Whenever `yarn start` is run in a project package, a dev server is created using this package.
